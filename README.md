# crypTxt 
Windows Phone 8.1 app that encrypts text messages via custom encryption. Does not use traditional encryptions algorithms. Using a combination of character conversions and blending algorithms it converts text to gobbly goop. I use a few other tricks to make it impossible to tell if the original text was a series of the same characters. I pulled some methods that would make the encryption (even with the same key) different everytime, but they proved to be somewhat of a hassle and overly volatile. You'll need a windows phone emulator to run this from VS
